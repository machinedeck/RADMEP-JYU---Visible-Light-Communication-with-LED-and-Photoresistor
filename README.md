# 8-Bit Data Transmission Using LED Visible Light Communication

This project is part of my **Measuring Techniques and Systems** class at the [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/en) last December 2023 during my Erasmus Mundus [RADMEP](https://master-radmep.org/) program. This was a group project with Nico and Ale where I was mostly responsible for the _design_, _characterization_, and _signal transfer/acquisition_.
